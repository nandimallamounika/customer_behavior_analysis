Customer Behavior Analysis — End-to-End Data Analytics Project

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of customer shopping behavior using a three-step workflow combining Python, SQL, and Power BI. The objective is to transform raw transaction data into cleaned, well-understood data; extract business-focused insights with rigorous SQL queries; and present those insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard that stakeholders can explore. The repository contains a Jupyter notebook for data preparation and exploratory analysis, a SQL script with production-ready analytical queries, and a Power BI report file that brings the analysis to life.

Step 1 — Data cleaning and exploratory analysis (Python / Jupyter Notebook)

In the first step I load the raw dataset into a Jupyter notebook and perform systematic data cleaning and preprocessing to make the data analysis-ready. This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, normalizing categorical fields (for example shipping type and subscription status), and engineering useful columns such as age groups and repeat-purchase counts. After cleaning, I carry out exploratory data analysis to describe distributions, spot outliers, and examine relationships between variables: revenue distributions, purchase amounts by demographic groups, the effect of discounts on spend, review rating distributions, and shipping-type comparisons. The notebook contains visualizations and narrative observations that document each transformation and finding, and it ends by exporting a cleaned dataset suitable for feeding into SQL queries and the Power BI dashboard.

Step 2 — Business analytics and insight extraction (SQL)

In the second step I import the cleaned dataset into a SQL environment (PostgreSQL recommended) and run a set of well-structured analytical queries designed to answer business questions. The SQL script computes revenue by gender, identifies customers who used discounts but still spent above the average, ranks top products by average review rating, and compares average purchases between standard and express shipping. It also measures subscriber behavior (average spend and total revenue for subscribers vs non-subscribers), calculates discount incidence by product, segments customers into New/Returning/Loyal groups based on previous purchases, and lists the top three products per category using window functions. Additional queries examine repeat-buyer subscription tendencies and the revenue contribution of each age group. Each query is written as a reusable block (using CTEs, aggregations, and ranking functions) so it can be adopted directly in reporting or automated pipelines.

Step 3 — Interactive reporting and stakeholder dashboard (Power BI)

The third step translates cleaned data and SQL results into an interactive Power BI dashboard that surfaces the most important metrics for business stakeholders. The dashboard includes KPI cards for total revenue and average order value, filterable charts for demographic and category analysis, drill-through pages to inspect product and customer segments, and visualization tiles that highlight the effect of discounts and subscriptions on spend. Slicers and cross-filtering allow users to explore scenarios (for example, viewing revenue by shipping type within a selected age group), and the design emphasizes clarity so that non-technical stakeholders can quickly identify top-performing products, profitable customer segments, and operational levers such as shipping and discount policies.

How to run the project (brief workflow)

To reproduce the work, start by running the Jupyter notebook: install the required Python packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn), open customer_behavior.ipynb, and execute the cells which perform cleaning, EDA, and export the cleaned CSV. Next, load the exported cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database (or your preferred SQL engine) and run the queries contained in customer_behavior_analysis.sql to recreate the business insights and aggregated tables. Finally, open customer_behaviour_dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop and either connect it to the cleaned dataset or import the aggregated SQL tables; refresh the visuals to reflect your local data and use the slicers to interact with the dashboard.

Summary of key findings

Across the steps the analysis consistently shows which customer groups and product categories drive revenue: subscription status and repeat buyers contribute disproportionately to total revenue, express shipping is often associated with higher spend, and specific age groups (notably working-age segments) account for the largest revenue share. Discount usage does not always imply lower spend—many customers using discounts still spend at or above the average—suggesting discounts can be targeted without eroding revenue. Product-level rankings and category breakdowns identify top items that are strong candidates for focused marketing and inventory prioritization.
